# AI Job Search Copilot

A human-centered AI web application designed to help people make better
decisions during the job search process.

---

## 🚩 The Problem

Job searching is emotionally exhausting.

Candidates spend hours:
- Reading job descriptions
- Tweaking resumes
- Applying blindly
- Receiving little to no feedback

Most existing tools optimize resumes for ATS systems,
but do not help people decide *where* and *how* to apply.

---

## 🎯 The Goal

Help users answer three key questions:

1. How well do I match this job?
2. Why is this a good (or bad) fit?
3. What should I realistically improve?

## 🧠 Core Features (MVP)

- CV ↔ Job Description matching
- Transparent fit score (0–100)
- Strengths and gaps breakdown
- Actionable recommendations

---

## 🤖 AI Philosophy

AI is used as an assistive layer, not a decision-maker.

Scoring logic is rule-based and explainable.
LLMs are used to generate human-friendly explanations and insights.
